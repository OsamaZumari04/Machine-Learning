# Power Efficiency Optimization

There is a room that contains 4 office desks and a big window in the wall. Also, there are sensors placed in different parts in the room, each desk has a sensor on it, and a sensor in the middle of the room, and a sensor above the door and another one towards it directly. The task is to detect how many people are in the room to enhance power saving by using the data that sensors collected. The task is important to minimize the high cost of electricity and be more environmental-friendly. In addition to extending the lifetime cycle for machines that use electricity by turning them off when no one use them. we will use Artificial Intelligence techniques to detect the occupancy of the room with the help of multiple sensors that are mentioned that produced helpful data to perform the task. In this project, supervised-classification machine learning was used. In addition to preprocessing techniques and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique.
